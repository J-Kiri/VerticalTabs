CSS for Firefox to replace the old horizontal tab layout with an attractive new Vertical Tabs layout for Windows.

This is heavily based on [FlyingFox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox), but replaces the material design in order to remain closer to how firefox is designed, and more closely follow the Windows layout.


## Installation

1. Based on the below table, chose whichever layout you want. You will only need to use one of these layouts, so the other two can be discarded.

2. Open the folder you have chosen (e.g. 'HoverLayout' if you'd like to use Vertical Tabs with the hover behavior).

3. Start with the 'chrome' folder in that Layout's directory, and view the corresponding folder's readme to continue installation.


## Vertical Tab Options

### 1. 'HoverLayout'

This configuration changes vertical tabs behavior to expand when hovering the mouse over it.

### 2. 'OverlayLayout'

This configuration changes vertical tabs behavior to expand and contract using a hotkey. While expanded, the tabs will hide page content behind it. This layout is best used with a quick [shortcut to toggle tst](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox)

### 3. 'StaticLayout'

Unlike the Overlay layout, the Static layout is permanently expanded, so the contents of the page will be resized as to not hide anything behind the tabs.

# Troubleshooting

- If the 'Tree Style Tab' header is appearing, and/or the top bar isn't functioning correctly, ensure 'toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets' is set to 'true' in 'about:config'.

- If the sidebar is not showing up at all after installation, be sure to left click the Tree Style Tab add-on in the top bar in order to turn on the extension.

# Known Issues

- Bookmarks toolbar not currently functional. Working on fix.
