# FirefoxTstWindows
CSS for firefox to enable attractive tree style tabs for Windows.

This is heavily based on [FlyingFox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox), but replaces the material design in order to remain closer to how firefox is designed, and more closely follow the Windows layout.

# Installation
Follow the installation instructions in the READMEs in both the 'chrome' folder and the 'Tree Style Tabs' folder.
