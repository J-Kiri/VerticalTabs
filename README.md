# Vertical Tabs for Firefox
CSS for firefox to replace the old horizontal tab layout with an attractive new Vertical Tabs layout for Windows.

This is heavily based on [FlyingFox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox), but replaces the material design in order to remain closer to how firefox is designed, and more closely follow the Windows layout.

# Installation
Follow the installation instructions in the READMEs in both the [chrome](https://github.com/astroryan12/VerticalTabs/tree/main/chrome) folder and the [Tree Style Tab](https://github.com/astroryan12/VerticalTabs/tree/main/TreeStyleTab) folder as both are necessary to create this layout. 

The [Tree Style Tab add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) is required.

Thanks to [h4wwk3ye](https://github.com/h4wwk3ye/firefoxCSS) for the improvements made on [Flying Fox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox), allowing me to adjust the layout to work well on Windows while keeping as close to Firefox's native design as possible.

# Troubleshooting

- If the sidebar is not showing up at all after installation, be sure to left click the Tree Style Tab add-on in the top bar in order to turn on the extension.

# Known Issues

- Pinned tabs not working properly
