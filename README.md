# FirefoxTstWindows
CSS for firefox to enable attractive tree style tabs for Windows.

This is heavily based on [FlyingFox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox), but replaces the material design in order to remain closer to how firefox is designed, and more closely follow the Windows layout.

# Installation
Follow the installation instructions in the READMEs in both the [chrome](https://github.com/astroryan12/FirefoxTstWindows/tree/main/chrome) folder and the [Tree Style Tab](https://github.com/astroryan12/FirefoxTstWindows/tree/main/TreeStyleTab) folder as both are necessary to create this layout. 

The [Tree Style Tab add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) is required.
