# UserChrome Configs

Unlike the Overlay layout, the Static layout is permanently expanded, so the contents of the page will be resized as to not hide anything behind the tabs.

### 1. `StaticLayout`

## Installation

1. Open your Firefox profile directory. To find your profile directory, type 'about:support' in Firefox's address bar.

2. If there is a `chrome` folder in this directory, delete it, and paste the new `chrome` folder into the profile directory.

3. In the Firefox address bar, type 'about:config' and search for 'toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets', setting it to 'true' if it's not already set to true.

4. Proceed to the Tree Style Tab setup folder.
