# UserChrome Configs

Unlike the Overlay layout, the Static layout is permanently expanded, so the contents of the page will be resized as to not hide anything behind the tabs.

### 1. `StaticLayout`

## Installation

1. Open your Firefox profile directory. To find your profile directory, type `about:support` in Firefox's address bar.

2. If there is a 'chrome' folder in this directory, delete it, and paste the new 'chrome' folder into the profile directory.

3. Proceed to the Tree Style Tab setup folder.
