# Changelog v0.2

- Fixed fullscreen mode behavior so the tabs automatically hide and will only reapper when moused over. This behavior makes the tabbars behavior consistent with Firefox UI which also hides in fullscreen mode. This applies to both the hover and the static overlays, but not the overlay layout as that layout allows you to dismiss the tabbar at will allowing you to regulate your pixel intake.

- Fixed an issue that blocked the bookmark toolbar from showing up on the new tab page (and elsewhere) in all three layouts.


## Previous updates

### Changelog v0.1

- Temporarily fixed pinned tabs not behaving properly. This should be a quick workaround until we determine a new way of organizing them.

- Provided a new 'extras' folder which will contain modifications to the behavior of the tabs. This update includes a 'no new tab button' modification that well, takes away the new tab button so you can just use a hotkey if you'd like to open a new tab.

   ##### Please note not all bugfixes will make it to the changelog, but I will try to include as many as possible :)
